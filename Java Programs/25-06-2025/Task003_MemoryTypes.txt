Task 3: Types of Computer Memory with Examples

1. Primary Memory (Main Memory)
   - RAM (Random Access Memory): Volatile, fast, used for temporary storage while programs run. Example: DDR4 RAM in laptops.
   - ROM (Read Only Memory): Non-volatile, stores firmware. Example: BIOS chip.

2. Secondary Memory
   - Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Non-volatile, large capacity, slower. Example: 1TB HDD.
   - Solid State Drive (SSD): Non-volatile, faster than HDD. Example: 512GB SSD.
   - Optical Disks: CDs, DVDs for backup/storage.

3. Cache Memory
   - Small, very fast memory between CPU and RAM. Example: L1, L2, L3 cache in processors.

4. Registers
   - Smallest, fastest memory inside CPU for immediate data processing.

5. Flash Memory
   - Used in USB drives, SD cards, SSDs.

6. Virtual Memory
   - Uses part of secondary storage as extra RAM.
