Hash Table Internals (Home Task)
===============================

- Hash table uses an array of buckets to store key-value pairs.
- Each key's hashCode() determines the bucket index.
- Collisions are handled by chaining (linked list/tree) or open addressing.
- Rehashing occurs when load factor exceeds threshold.
- Provides O(1) average time for put/get operations.
