Task 15: Linear probing in Hash table (skeleton, see full code in prompt)

Linear probing is a collision resolution technique in open addressing hash tables.
If a collision occurs, the algorithm checks the next slot (index + 1) until an empty slot is found.
This reduces the need for linked lists but can cause clustering.

Example: See LinearProbingHashTable class in your prompt for full implementation.
