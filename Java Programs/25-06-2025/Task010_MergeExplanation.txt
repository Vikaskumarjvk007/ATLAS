Task 10: What is the above code snippet doing?

The code merges two sorted integer arrays (arr1 and arr2) into a single sorted array (merge).
It prints both input arrays, then iterates through both, comparing elements and adding the smaller one to the merged array.
After one array is exhausted, it copies the remaining elements from the other array.
Finally, it prints the merged, sorted array.
