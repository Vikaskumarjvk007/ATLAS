Task 11: What do you know about hash table?

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
Hash tables provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
They handle collisions using techniques like chaining or open addressing.
In Java, Hashtable and HashMap are common implementations.
