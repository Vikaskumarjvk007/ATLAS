Task 14: Hash table advantages and disadvantages

Advantages:
- Fast data access (O(1) average time for search, insert, delete)
- Efficient for large datasets
- Simple implementation for key-value pairs
- Useful for implementing caches, symbol tables, etc.

Disadvantages:
- Performance degrades with many collisions
- Fixed size (unless rehashed)
- Not ordered
- Hash functions can be tricky to design
- Uses more memory than some alternatives
- In Java, Hashtable is synchronized (slower than HashMap)
