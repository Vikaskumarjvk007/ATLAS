Task 5: What are the operations on data structures?

Common operations on data structures include:
1. Insertion: Adding new elements.
2. Deletion: Removing elements.
3. Traversal: Accessing each element (e.g., for display).
4. Searching: Finding an element.
5. Sorting: Arranging elements in a specific order.
6. Updating: Modifying an element's value.

These operations vary in complexity and efficiency depending on the data structure used.
